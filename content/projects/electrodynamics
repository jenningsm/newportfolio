ELECTRODYNAMICS

Electrodynamics is a very simple Android app I built that generates
lightning bolt visuals when the screen is touched.
You can download it for free from the play store.

The app was built in Java and uses OpenGL for the graphics.

Available for free $(here,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mjngs.gllightning)
