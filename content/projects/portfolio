OLD PORTFOLIO

My old portfolio site was a single-page, no-scroll site. You can check out the
code on $(Github,https://github.com/jenningsm/portfolio), but it was built
with a $(node library,https://github.com/jenningsm/element.js)
I'm developing that, unfortunately, I have yet to document, so it might
not make a lot of sense. 

After I finished building the site, I built a new one (this site) to replace
it, partly because the no-scroll format made it difficult to include the
content I thought my site needed, and partly because I just 
wanted to build something. The site is still available at the link below.
