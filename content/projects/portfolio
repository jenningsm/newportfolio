OLD PORTFOLIO

My old portfolio site. It's a relatively simple site. I built it as a no-scroll site
which, in hindsight, limited the content I could
display on it and made it hard to format. You can check out the
code on $(Github,https://github.com/jenningsm/portfolio), but it was built
with a $(node library,https://github.com/jenningsm/element.js)
I'm developing that, unfortunately, I have yet to document, so it might
not make a lot of sense. 

After I finished building it, I built a new site (this one) to replace it, partly because
of the reason I mentioned above and partly because I just wanted to build
something.
