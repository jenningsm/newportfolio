DEFTLY

$(www.deftsketches.com)

Deftly is a website I built to display some of my generative sketches.
It's a relatively simple single-page site, but features elegant transitions from sketch to sketch.
I need to add length to this description to see how it looks. It features some of my generative
art work which some was done in processing and stuff.
