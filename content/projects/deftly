DEFTLY

Deftly is a website I built to display some of my generative sketches.
It's a relatively simple single-page site. A lot of work went into
crafting the transitions from sketch to sketch, and I think they turned
out well. Building it was really
an adventure in javascript. Unfortunately, the javascript I wrote ended up
being pretty much unmaintainable, but I learned alot from the experience and now
make a great effort to keep my code as simple as possible. You can see the code for yourself on
$(Github,https://github.com/jenningsm/deft).
