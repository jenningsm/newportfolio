DEFTLY

Deftly is a website I built to display some of my generative sketches. You can see it $(here).
It's a relatively simple single-page site, but features elegant transitions from sketch to sketch.
I need to add length to this description to see how it looks. It features some of my generative
art work which some was done in processing and stuff.

The second part of the description I have to make it span at least more than one line so I'll write
this stuff.
