DEFTLY

Deftly is a single-page website I built to display some of my generative
sketches. A lot of work went into
crafting the transitions from sketch to sketch, and I think they turned
out well. Building it was really
an adventure in javascript. Unfortunately, the javascript I wrote ended up
being pretty much unmaintainable, but I learned a lot from the experience
and now make a great effort to keep my code as simple as possible.
You can see the code for yourself on
