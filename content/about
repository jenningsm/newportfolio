My name is Michael Jennings. I'm a software developer living in Portland and 
am looking for work as a front-end developer. I graduated from University of 
California, Los Angeles with a B.S. in Computer Science. I like to build
beautiful things with code. 

I've had software $(internships,@experience) at Amazon, ViaSat, and D&B Credibility Corporation.
At each of these companies, I've worked with the back-end, but am now looking to make
a switch over to the front-end. I've been working on my own 
time to develop my front-end skills, and have come to a
solid understanding of Javascript, HTML, and CSS. I'm learning quickly, and each
my $(projects,@projects) is substantially better than the one that came before it.
While I don't have extensive experience with popular frameworks or libraries, I'm
more than able to pick up whatever I need to to get my job done.
