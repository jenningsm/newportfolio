My name is Michael Jennings. I'm a software developer living in Portland and 
am looking for work as a front-end developer.

I graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles with a degree in Computer
Science. I've had $(internships,@experience) at Amazon, ViaSat, and D&B Credibility Corporation.
Most of my previous experience has been with the backend, but I'm now looking to make the switch
over to the front end. I've been working on my own time to develop my skills, and have come to a
solid understanding of HTML, CSS, and especially Javascript. I'm a quick learner and can pick up whatever
I need to to get my job done. Check out some of my $(projects,@projects).

I like to make beautiful things with code, my style is minimalist, and I like to do things
differently. Feel free to $(reach out,mailto:mpjngs@gmail.com) to me.
