VIASAT

I worked as a Software Engineering Intern at ViaSat during the Summer of 2012.
While there, I worked on a team of three interns to develop a prototype
for a home security and automation system. We had a functioning prototype
by the end of the Summer.

I worked primarily in Java. My
responsibilities on the team included setting up and maintaining an Enterprise
Service Bus, developing a rules database using the Drools rules engine, and
creating a framework for interfacing with heterogeneous smart devices.
